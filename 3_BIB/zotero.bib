	abstract = {In pavement ME design, the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) is used to estimate the resilient modulus of unbound material at different saturation conditions based on the enhanced integrated climatic model (EICM). The Fredlund-Xing equation is employed to generate the SWCC and the fitting parameters of the equation are correlated to the soil physical properties using regression models. However, the prediction accuracy of this method needs to be improved. To solve this problem, this study employs an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to improve the prediction accuracy of the SWCC fitting parameters. A new set of SWCC-related soil physical properties are selected to predict the SWCC. A large number of soil datasets collected from the NCHRP 9-23A project are used to develop the ANN models. The developed ANN models of the SWCC fitting parameters are used to predict the suction-water content relationship. The R2 values were found to be 0.9 and 0.95 for predicting the SWCC curves of plastic and non-plastic soils respectively, which are significantly higher than existing correlation models. The prediction accuracy of the developed ANN models are validated by comparing the measured and predicted matric suction of new soils datasets that are not used to train the ANN models. © Copyright 2018 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

	abstract = {Soil-Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) is an important relationship between matric suction and volumetric water content of soils especially when dealing with unsaturated soil problems, these problems may include seepage, bearing capacity, volume change, etc. where the matric or total suction may have a considerable effect on unsaturated soil properties. Obtaining an accurate SWCC for a soil could be cumbersome and sometimes it is time consuming and needs effort for some soils, either through laboratory tests or through field tests. Accurate prediction of this curve can give more precise expectations in design or analysis that include some unsaturated soil properties, which can save more effort and time. This work will concentrate on proposing a new approach for determining the SWCC using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) depending on some soil properties (air-entry point and residual degree of saturation) through computer software MatLab as a tool for ANN. The new approach is to plot the SWCC curve points instead of obtaining the parameters used in Brooks and Corey (BC) Model (1964), van Genuchten (VG) Model (1980), or Fredlund and Xing (FX) Model (1994). Results showed close agreement in determination of the SWCC by verification of the ANN results with an additional curve sample. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

	abstract = {Approximate estimates employing the pedotransfer function (PTF) for predicting the soil-water characteristic curve have received general agreement among the geotechnical engineering society. Notably, the machine-learning-based PTFs (ML-PTFs) offer robust approaches with high prediction accuracy. This study analyzed the potential factors governing the prediction accuracy of the neural-network-based PTF (NN-PTF), which is one of the most popular ML-PTFs. Multiple analysis scenarios for the NN structure, learning algorithm and data processing were presented to evaluate the influence of these components. The analyses were performed on the UNsaturated Soil hydraulic DAtabase, which consists of a broad range of soil types. It is noted that employing the Bayesian regularization significantly improved the prediction accuracy for the same NN structure and optimizing algorithm when compared to using the early stopping, i.e., the maximum reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.014. Architectural selection of the network worked most efficiently in case of the Bayesian regularization neural network (BRNN), i.e., RMSE dropped by 36\% when the number of neurons increased from 9 to 54. Contrarily, an insignificant variation of RMSE indicated that increasing the NN complexity did not affect the performance of NN-PTF with the conjugate gradient descent and the early stopping. In addition, training the NN-PTF with a well-processed dataset could improve the prediction accuracy, i.e., the maximum reduction in RMSE was 0.004. Overall, the three-hidden-layer BRNN trained by the processed dataset outperformed the other scenarios in consideration, with RMSE = 0.028 and R2 = 0.977. Consequently, the data pre-processing and Bayesian regularization are strongly suggested for deriving the NN-PTF.},

LSTM is an approach that employs time sequence data to predict future occurrences, and it can be used to consider the stress history of soil behaviour. The proposed LSTM method includes the following three steps: data preparation, architecture determination, and optimisation. The capacity of the adapted LSTM method is compared with that of feedforward and feedback neural networks using a new numerical benchmark dataset. The performance of the proposed LSTM method is verified through a dataset collected from laboratory tests. The results indicate that the LSTM deep-learning method outperforms the feed forward and feedback neural networks based on both accuracy and the convergence rate when reproducing the soil's stress–strain behaviour. One new phenomenon referred to as “bias at low stress levels”, which was not noticed before, is first discovered and discussed for all neural network-based methods.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning methods and, in particular, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in material constitutive modeling. One of the main drawbacks of such approaches is the lack of a rigorous frame based on the laws of physics. This may render physically inconsistent the predictions of a trained network, which can be even dangerous for real applications. Here we propose a new class of data-driven, physics-based, neural networks for constitutive modeling of strain rate independent processes at the material point level, which we define as Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANNs). The two basic principles of thermodynamics are encoded in the network's architecture by taking advantage of automatic differentiation to compute the numerical derivatives of a network with respect to its inputs. In this way, derivatives of the free-energy, the dissipation rate and their relation with the stress and internal state variables are hardwired in the architecture of TANNs. Consequently, our approach does not have to identify the underlying pattern of thermodynamic laws during training, reducing the need of large data-sets. Moreover the training is more efficient and robust, and the predictions more accurate. Finally and more important, the predictions remain thermodynamically consistent, even for unseen data. Based on these features, TANNs are a starting point for data-driven, physics-based constitutive modeling with neural networks. We demonstrate the wide applicability of TANNs for modeling elasto-plastic materials, using both hyper- and hypo-plasticity models. Strain hardening and softening are also considered for the hyper-plastic scenario. Detailed comparisons show that the predictions of TANNs outperform those of standard ANNs. Finally, we demonstrate that the implementation of the laws of thermodynamics confers to TANNs high robustness in the presence of noise in the training data, compared to standard approaches. TANNs' architecture is general, enabling applications to materials with different or more complex behavior, without any modification.},

	abstract = {Based on neural network material-modeling technologies, a new paradigm, called multi-output support vector regression, is developed to model complex stress/strain behavior of materials. The constitutive information generally implicitly contained in the results of experiments, i.e., the relationships between stresses and strains, can be captured by training a support vector regression model within a unified architecture from experimental data. This model, inheriting the merits of the neural network based models, can be employed to model the behavior of modern, complex materials such as composites. Moreover, the architectures of the support vector regression built in this research can be more easily determined than that of the neural network. Therefore, the proposed constitutive models can be more conveniently applied to finite element analysis and other application fields. As an illustration, the behaviors of concrete in the state of plane stress under monotonic biaxial loading and compressive uniaxial cycle loading are modeled with the multi-output and single-output support regression respectively. The excellent results show that the support vector regression provides another effective approach for material modeling.},

	abstract = {A new method, termed autoprogressive training, for training neural networks to learn complex stress—strain behaviour of materials using global load—deflection response measured in a structural test is described. The richness of the constitutive information that is generally implicitly contained in the results of structural tests may in many cases make it possible to train a neural network material model from only a small number of such tests, thus overcoming one of the perceived limitations of a neural network approach to modelling of material behaviour; namely, that a voluminous amount of material test data is required. The method uses the partially-trained neural network in a central way in an iterative non-linear finite element analysis of the test specimen in order to extract approximate, but gradually improving, stress—strain information with which to train the neural network. An example is presented in which a simple neural network constitutive model of a T300/976 graphite/ epoxy unidirectional lamina is trained, using the load—deflection response recorded during a destructive compressive test of a [(\$45)!]I laminated structural plate containing an open hole. The results of a subsequent forward analysis are also presented, in which the trained material model is used to simulate the response of a compressively loaded [(\$30)!]I structural laminate containing an open hole. Avenues for further improvement of the neural network model are also suggested. The proposed autoprogressive algorithm appears to have wide application in the general area of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and damage detection. Most NDE experiments can be viewed as structural tests and the proposed methodology can be used to determine certain damage indices, similar to the way in which constitutive models are determined.},

	abstract = {Recently, there is a strong interest in the modelling of reservoir fluid flow with geomechanical deformation. With the help of geomechanics, many physical phenomena can be explained, e.g. reservoir compaction and subsidence, casing failure or pore collapse. Several methods for coupling geomechanics to fluid flow in the reservoir have been proposed: fully coupled, iterative coupled and explicit coupled methods. The iterative coupled method has proven to be the most effective approach. However, no paper has discussed this method in detail from a reservoir engineering perspective. In this paper, the iterative coupling method is described step by step from the basic equations for geomechanics and reservoir flow to the coupling technique through porosity and permeability. This description is aimed at reservoir engineers with little background in geomechanics. A number of examples using different nonlinear constitutive models such as elastoplasticity model, elastoplastic cap model and dilation-recompaction model are used to illustrate the importance of including geomechanics in reservoir simulation.

	abstract = {Summary An iterative procedure is presented in this paper to couple geomechanics and reservoir simulation models for the simulation of weaker rock formations with complex constitutive behavior. Parallel computing is employed in the coupled model to reduce run time in the compute intensive geomechanics model. The procedures developed here are general, and can be applied to any reservoir simulation and geomechanics model. Field and example problems under a variety of exploitation scenarios are presented to demonstrate the utility and robust nature of the coupled model. For example, a large-scale field case was simulated using the coupled model with 16 processors for the geomechanics model. The total CPU time for a 30-year simulation run was approximately 2 hours. These results indicate that it is both economical and practical to use the proposed procedure and parallel computing for analyzing field-scale problems that integrate reservoir and geomechanics simulation. Introduction Conventional reservoir simulators calculate the effect of rock compaction on pore volume change through the concept of rock compressibility under a defined loading condition (hydrostatic or uniaxial strain). This approach is usually appropriate for reservoirs with competent rock. However, for weaker formations and complicated rock-compaction behavior, coupled analysis of geomechanics and multiphase fluid flow may be required for obtaining more accurate solutions from reservoir simulation (for ex},

The advances of the theory and numerical implementation since the original work1 make it practical to perform full-field coupled studies with complex, realistic descriptions of the geomechanical behavior of the reservoir and shales, which allows prediction of stress changes, reservoir compaction, and surface subsidence. These capabilities are demonstrated in field examples that analyze and predict classical pressure-induced compaction in a gas field and thermally induced compaction in a heavy-oil field. In both cases, the methodology of interpreting the geomechanical laboratory and field data and their integration in the coupled modeling process was the key to obtaining a realistic predictive tool. The examples demonstrate that the technology is maturing to the point that conventional studies can be converted to coupled modeling on a fairly routine basis.},

The model is based upon the approach proposed by one of the authors which fully couples geomechanical effects to multiphase flow. Their work is extended here to include non-isothermal effects. The gas phase contribution to the energy equation has been neglected based on a set of assumptions. The coupled formulation given herein differs in several ways when compared to the earlier work and an attempt is made to link the flow based formulation and mixture theory. The Finite Element Method is employed for the numerical treatment and essential algorithmic implementation is discussed. Numerical examples are presented to provide further understanding of the current methodology. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

	doi = {10.2118/119084-PA},
	abstract = {We perform detailed stability and convergence analyses of sequential- implicit solution methods for coupled fluid flow and reservoir geomechanics. We analyze four different sequential-implicit solution strategies, where each subproblem (flow and mechanics) is solved implicitly: two schemes in which the mechanical problem is solved first-namely, the drained and undrained splits-and two schemes in which the flow problem is solved first-namely, the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits. The von Neumann method is used to obtain the linear-stability criteria of the four sequential schemes, and numerical simulations are used to test the validity and sharpness of these criteria for representative problems. The analysis indicates that the drained and fixed-strain splits, which are commonly used, are conditionally stable and that the stability limits depend only on the strength of coupling between flow and mechanics and are independent of the timestep size. Therefore, the drained and fixed-strain schemes cannot be used when the coupling between flow and mechanics is strong. Moreover, numerical solutions obtained using the drained and fixed-strain sequential schemes suffer from oscillations, even when the stability limit is honored. For problems where the deformation may be plastic (nonlinear) in nature, the drained and fixed-strain sequential schemes become unstable when the system enters the plastic regime. On the other hand, the undrained and fixed-stress sequential schemes are unconditionally stable regardless of the coupling strength, and they do not suffer from oscillations. While both the undrained and fixed-stress schemes are unconditionally stable, for the cases investigated we found that the fixed-stress split converges more rapidly than the undrained split. On the basis of these findings, we strongly recommend the fixed-stress sequential-implicit method for modeling coupled flow and geomechanics in reservoirs.
